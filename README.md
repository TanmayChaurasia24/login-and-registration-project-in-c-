# login-and-registration-project-in-c++ 
I have created an login an registration system with the help of basic concepts of c++ like file-management,switch case etc. in this project a user can register them self and they can login and if they forgot there password then they can write there username and we will show there password.
i know this is not the best project but i have made this project jsut to enhance my c++ skills.
